    "If we were given a mutable string representation instead of an immutable string, we can perform the reverse operation in-place. Let's assume we are given a list of characters, which we will modify in-place. We can easily reverse a substring within a string in O(N) time and O(1) space. However, simply reversing the entire string or reversing each word won't get return the correct solution -- we must do both operations. First, we reverse the entire string to get the string \"ereh dlrow olleh\". Then, we reverse each word within the string to obtain the original words: \"here world hello\"."

    "The algorithm seems rather straightforward, but there are quite a few edge cases. We need to make sure that we handle when there are multiple delimiters in a row, as well as delimiters at the beginning and/or end of the string. One way we can handle these cases is by iterating through the string, and adding delimiters to the output when they appear. When we reach a word, we add the word from the end of the string instead of the current word. In order to do this, we pre-process the string into a list of words and reverse the list."

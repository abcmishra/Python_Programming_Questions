    "We can see that the minimum number of steps would be to walk as many diagonal steps as possible, and then walk directly to the second point. If we were to walk directly vertically and then horizontally, it would be a greater number of steps. We can break down the diagonal and vertical/horizontal components by taking the adding the minimum of the vertical or horizontal differences with the remaining distance"
